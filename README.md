# HYPERSPACE Node Joining Guide

## â€¢ Fundraising: 55 Million USD

**Introduction:**

@HyperspaceAI is building a browser-based blockchain supercomputer aimed at providing users with secure and controllable artificial intelligence applications.

## Steps to Join

### 1. Access the Official Website

First, open your browser and visit the following URL:

[http://node.hyper.space](http://node.hyper.space)

GitHub: [http://github.com/hyperspaceai](http://github.com/hyperspaceai)

### 2. Activate Node

1. **Select Model and Activate Switch:**
   
   - At **Arrow 1**, select the model.
   - At **Arrow 2**, find and toggle the red switch. After this action, a message will pop up: "Allocated and ready to accept challenges." The system will automatically configure the settings. Please wait a few minutes until the configuration is complete.

2. **Choose How to Run Your Node:**

   You can choose one of the following two methods to run your node:
   
   - **Use the Browser:** Run the node directly in the browser without downloading any additional software.
   - **Download the Hyperspace Application:** If you prefer using a dedicated application, you can download and install the Hyperspace application.

3. **Increase Activity**

   To ensure your node remains active and earns a higher rating, please ensure the following:
   
   - **Stay Online:** The node needs to remain continuously online to handle network requests and challenges. This directly affects your activity score.
   - **Complete All Activities:** Regularly check and complete the activities required by the platform to maintain and improve your node's rating.
   
   **Note:** This project has high demands for RAM and computing resources and relies on users sharing RAM for data computation. If your device has low performance, please participate cautiously to avoid affecting the device's operation.
